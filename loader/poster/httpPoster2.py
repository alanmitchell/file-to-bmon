APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}" replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include the brackets!) The text should be enclosed in the appropriate comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a file or class name and description of purpose be included on the same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier identification within third-party archives.

TO DO:
    * Test separate threads writing to post_time_file simultaneously
    * Perhaps abandon post if it isn't successful after a few retries. It would
        be left in the 'processing' queue, so would get tried again upon a
        restart. This protects against some bad format locking up a post worker.
        But if post is abandoned and Internet comes back, it will be left in
        processing queue.
